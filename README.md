# swapi-wiki
A SPA wiki based on the swapi (Star Wars API) written in React.JS. This is my first React.JS app built from the ground up so its not going to be perfect! I must say though its a fantastic JavaScript library, once you get your head around some of the fundamentals its really intuitive, the applications basically write themselves! Good stuff!

# Installation
To install run the following command:

    npm run install

# Running The Application
After you have installed the application locally, build via this command:

    npm run build

Then to execute:

    npm run start

If all is well a server should have started in the console. Now all you need to do is visit this address:

    http://localhost:8080/

Have fun!
