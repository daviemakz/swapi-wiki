# swapi-wiki
A SPA wiki based on the swapi (Star Wars API) written in React.JS. This is my first React.JS app built from the ground up so its not going to be perfect! Might dabble in this going forward though...

# Installation
To install run the following command:

    npm run install

# Running The Application
After you have installed the application locally, build via this command:

    npm run build

Then to execute:

    npm run start

If all is well a server should have started in the console. Now all you need to do is visit this address:

    http://localhost:8080/

Have fun!
